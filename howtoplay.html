			<h1>How To Play Secret&nbsp;Reichstag / Secret&nbsp;Hitler</h1>
			<h2>Secret Hitler</h2>
			<p>These rules are taken from the <a href="https://www.secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf">official rulebook of the game</a></p>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
				At the beginning of the game, each player
				is secretly assigned to one of three roles:
				<b>Liberal</b>, <b>Fascist</b>, or <b>Hitler</b>.<br>
				The Liberals have
				a majority, but they don't know for sure who
				anyone is; Fascists must resort to secrecy and
				sabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays
				for the Fascist team, and the Fascists know
				Hitler's identity from the outset, but Hitler
				doesn't know the Fascists and must work to
				figure them out.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Liberals win by enacting five Liberal
				Policies or killing Hitler. The Fascists win by
				enacting six Fascist Policies, or if Hitler is
				elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies
				have been enacted.
				Whenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the
				government becomes more powerful, and the
				President is granted a single-use power which
				must be used before the next round can begin. It
				doesn't matter what team the President is on; in
				fact, even Liberal players might be tempted to
				enact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers.
			</p>
	
			<h2>Secret Reichstag</h2>
			<p>
				Secret Reichstag expands upon the rules of Secret Hitler and should only be played if you know the rules of Secret Hitler.
			</p>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>
				Secret Reichstag adds a third party to the game: <b>Communists</b>. They consist of the roles <b>Communist</b> and <b>Stalin</b> and work similar to Fascists.
				Communists know who Stalin is, but Stalin doesn't know the Communists' identities. They work in direct opposition to both Fascists and Liberals.
